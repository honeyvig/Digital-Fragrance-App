=======================
To develop an AI-powered fragrance customization app as described, you'll need to focus on a number of technical components including mobile app development, AI integration, NFC functionality, and backend services. Below is a Python-based framework for integrating some of the key functionalities such as AI-driven fragrance recommendations and NFC-based tracking. The full solution would require cross-platform mobile app development (using frameworks like Flutter or React Native), but I’ll outline how the AI components can be developed in Python for backend functionality.
Key Areas to Focus On:

    Mobile App Development (iOS & Android): Using frameworks like Flutter or React Native for building cross-platform apps.
    AI-driven Scent Recommendations: Using machine learning for recommending fragrance combinations.
    NFC Integration: Enabling NFC features to track fragrance usage and access exclusive content.
    Backend Development: Storing user preferences, activity logs, and tracking user engagement.

High-Level Architecture

    Mobile App (iOS/Android): A front-end app built in Flutter or React Native.
    Backend: A Python-based API (using Flask or Django) to handle the AI processing, user profiles, scent recommendations, and NFC tracking.
    AI Engine: Use a machine learning recommendation engine (like scikit-learn or a custom model) to suggest scents based on user preferences.
    Database: Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store user preferences, scent combinations, and logs.

Step-by-Step Python Code for AI and NFC Features
1. AI-Driven Scent Recommendation System

We'll create a basic recommendation system using machine learning based on user mood, activity, and preferences.
Install Required Libraries

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

Create a Simple AI Recommendation Model

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Example data of fragrance combinations with user preferences
data = {
    "mood": ["happy", "relaxed", "energetic", "romantic", "calm", "focused"],
    "activity": ["workout", "study", "relax", "date", "meditate", "work"],
    "fragrance": ["citrus", "lavender", "mint", "rose", "vanilla", "cedarwood"],
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert categorical data to numeric (encoding moods, activities)
df['mood_encoded'] = df['mood'].astype('category').cat.codes
df['activity_encoded'] = df['activity'].astype('category').cat.codes

# Features: Mood and Activity, Target: Fragrance
features = df[['mood_encoded', 'activity_encoded']]
target = df['fragrance']

# Normalize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Train a recommendation model (using k-Nearest Neighbors for simplicity)
model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
model.fit(features_scaled)

def recommend_fragrance(user_mood, user_activity):
    mood_encoded = pd.Series(user_mood).astype('category').cat.codes
    activity_encoded = pd.Series(user_activity).astype('category').cat.codes
    
    user_features = [[mood_encoded, activity_encoded]]
    user_features_scaled = scaler.transform(user_features)
    
    # Get nearest fragrance recommendation
    _, indices = model.kneighbors(user_features_scaled)
    recommended_fragrance = df.iloc[indices[0]]['fragrance'].values[0]
    return recommended_fragrance

# Example usage
user_mood = "happy"
user_activity = "workout"
recommended_fragrance = recommend_fragrance(user_mood, user_activity)
print(f"Recommended fragrance: {recommended_fragrance}")

In this example, we’ve created a simple AI recommendation system using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend fragrances based on user mood and activity. You can expand this by adding more features (like time of day, weather, etc.) or using a more complex model.
2. NFC Tracking for Fragrance Usage

You’ll need to integrate NFC technology to track when a user sprays a fragrance and logs the usage. For this, you'd typically work with mobile devices using NFC libraries, but here’s a basic Python example of how you might process NFC tags for tracking purposes.
Example of NFC Integration with Python

For actual NFC hardware integration, you might use libraries like nfcpy to read NFC tags on mobile devices or external NFC readers.

pip install nfcpy

import nfc

# Define NFC reader
def on_connect(tag):
    print("NFC tag connected!")
    print("Tag info:", tag)

# Set up the NFC reader
clf = nfc.ContactlessFrontend('usb')
clf.connect(rdwr={'on-connect': on_connect})

This is a simple code snippet for connecting an NFC reader to a Python application. When a user scans an NFC-enabled fragrance bottle, it would trigger the connection and log the fragrance usage. You can link the NFC tag ID with a specific fragrance bottle and log the usage in the backend.
3. Backend System to Store User Profiles and Usage Analytics

To track user preferences and scent usage, you will need a backend system. Here’s a simple Flask-based backend to store and retrieve user data.
Install Flask and SQLite

pip install Flask flask_sqlalchemy

Create Flask Backend for Storing Preferences

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///fragrance_app.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define the User model
class UserProfile(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    mood = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    activity = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    fragrance = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)

# Initialize the database
db.create_all()

# Endpoint to log user preference
@app.route('/log_preference', methods=['POST'])
def log_preference():
    data = request.get_json()
    user_profile = UserProfile(
        mood=data['mood'],
        activity=data['activity'],
        fragrance=data['fragrance']
    )
    db.session.add(user_profile)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Preference logged successfully!"})

# Endpoint to get fragrance recommendations
@app.route('/get_recommendation', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendation():
    mood = request.args.get('mood')
    activity = request.args.get('activity')
    fragrance = recommend_fragrance(mood, activity)
    return jsonify({"recommended_fragrance": fragrance})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This Flask backend will allow users to log their mood, activity, and fragrance preferences and provide fragrance recommendations. You can expand this to handle more sophisticated user data or incorporate NFC-based tracking.
Conclusion

The solution consists of the following parts:

    AI-driven recommendation engine: Based on mood and activity, you can generate fragrance suggestions using machine learning.
    Mobile app: Cross-platform app development using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
    NFC integration: NFC tracking for fragrance usage.
    Backend: A Flask-based backend that stores user preferences and tracks engagement.

This setup gives you a scalable architecture to develop an AI-powered fragrance customization app that enhances the user experience while leveraging NFC and machine learning technologies.
